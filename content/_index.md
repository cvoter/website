      The **Voter Research Group** is led by [Carolyn Voter](author/carolyn-b.-voter) and based in the departments of [Civil,
      Construction, and Environmental Engineering](https://ce.udel.edu/) and
      [Earth Sciences](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/departments/es/) at
      the University of Delaware. We are also affiliated with several
      interdisciplinary groups on campus, including:
      * [The Delaware Environmental Institute](https://www.denin.udel.edu/)
      * [The Data Science Institute](https://dsi.udel.edu/)
      * The [Water Science and Policy](https://www.udel.edu/grad/prospective-students/programs/interdisciplinary/water-science-policy/) graduate program
      * [The Center for Applied Coastal Research](https://coastal.udel.edu/)
      
      # Our Mission 
      Across the world, urbanization is expanding, agricultural demand is
      intensifying, and the climate is changing. We respond to these challenges
      by using models, data, and stakeholder engagement to identify ways to more
      sustainably and equitably 1) manage water resources, 2) preserve ecosystem
      services, and 3) increase community resilience. We take pride in ensuring
      that our work is reproducible.
      
      # Our Vision
      Our goal is to produce solid science that is disseminated through
      scientific journals and conferences and that informs the decisions and
      actions of communities, regulators, and policymakers. As we do this
      science, we will also advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in our lab,
      our university, and our local and professional communities.
