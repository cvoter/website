# Bio
My overarching goal lies in making coastal communities resilient to climate change using either hydrological models or field works. In Dr. Voterâ€™s lab, I work on integrating models to investigate how sea level rise impact groundwater, stormwater, and sanitary sewer facilities in coastal communities. Outside research, I love to spend a lot of time watching true crime series and every other mystery movie or show.
