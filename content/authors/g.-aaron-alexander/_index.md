# Bio
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Water Resources Engineering Department. I am a member of the [Hydroclimate Extremes Research Group](https://her.cee.wisc.edu/) and [Hydroecology Lab](https://hydroecology.cee.wisc.edu/) and advised by Dr. Daniel B. Wright, Dr. Steve Lohiede II, and Dr. Carolyn B. Voter.

My work is motivated by the links between the atmosphere, water, and society where extremes are intensifying, urbanization is expanding, and the climate continues to change.

I utilize observational data, physically based models, and statistical techniques to 1) investigate emerging hydrologic based adaptions, 2) quantify processes effect on day-to-day meteorology and climate extremes, and ultimately 3) identify key actions that can improve environmental sustainability.
