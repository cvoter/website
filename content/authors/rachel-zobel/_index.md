# Bio
My research is rooted in utilizing an interdisciplinary approach to identify challenges and best practices associated with green stormwater infrastructure as a strategy for managing stormwater runoff effectively, maximizing ecosystem services and co-benefits, and meeting environmental regulatory requirements and water quality standards. Outside of research, you can find me outside camping, hiking, and kayaking or inside at a museum, reading a book, or playing Nintendo Switch!
