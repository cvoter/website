# Bio
I am an assistant professor in the departments of Civil, Construction, and
Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences at the University of Delaware.
After receiving my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I served as a
Wisconsin Water Resources Science-Policy Fellow at the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources before joining UD in 2022. My research broadly focuses on
using integrated hydrologic models, data, and stakeholder engagement to identify
ways to more sustainably and equitably manage water resources, preserve
ecosystem services, and increase community resilience. My work is currently
supported by the National Science Foundation Strengthening American
Infrastructure program, Delaware Sea Grant, and the Department of Defense
Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP).

In my personal time, I enjoy reading (non-fiction, fantasy, cozy mysteries), outdoor activities (running, hiking, walking, bird watching, barebow archery), and board games (current favorites include Sleeping Gods, Scout, and Food Chain Island).
