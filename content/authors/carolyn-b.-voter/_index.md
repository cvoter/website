# Bio
I am an assistant professor in the departments of Civil, Construction, and
Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences at the University of Delaware.
After receiving my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I served as a
Wisconsin Water Resources Science-Policy Fellow at the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources before joining UD in 2022. My research broadly focuses on
using integrated hydrologic models, data, and stakeholder engagement to identify
ways to more sustainably and equitably manage water resources, preserve
ecosystem services, and increase community resilience. My work is currently
supported by the National Science Foundation Strengthening American
Infrastructure program, Delaware Sea Grant, and the Department of Defense
Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP).

# Interests
## Research
- Hydrologic feedbacks: surface water-groundwater interactions, land-atmosphere interactions
- Integrated hydrologic modeling, high throughput/high performance computing
- Urban ecohydrology, green stormwater infrastructure, stormwater management
- Sustainable and resilient communities, coupled human-natural systems

## For Fun
- Reading, especially non-fiction, fantasy, and cozy mysteries
- Barebow archery (extreme novice)
- Running, hiking, walking, bird watching and other outdoor activities
- Board games such as current favorites Wingspan, Sleeping Gods, and Food Chain Island
