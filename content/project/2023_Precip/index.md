## Key Questions
- How can we appropriately project historical precipitation into the future for continuous stormwater and groundwater simulations?
- How can we make sure the process is usable by others?

## Status
This project is in a **manuscript preparation** phase as of Summer 2025

## Funding
- **DOD Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)**. Integrated Assessment of Climate Change Impacts to Groundwater, Stormwater, and Wastewater Infrastructure at Coastal Military Facilities. Project number: NH23-7762. Lead PI: Voter.
