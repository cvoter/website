## Key Questions
- What are current challenges the Chesapeake Bay stormwater community faces with respect to ensuring that green stormwater infrastructure is hydrologically effective and that benefits are distributed equitably?
- When communities say that they want more green infrastructure in their neighborhood, what do they hope it will do? To what extent do community preferences and hydrologic predictions align?

## Key Findings
- Stormwater professionals in the Chesapeake Bay region agree that:
	1. Maintenance of GSI is a top concern
	2. Valuing the long-term costs and benefits of GSI remains challenging
	3. "Good" community engagement is key to success

## Status
- Our initial discussions with stormwater professionals in the Chesapeake Bay are **complete** and summarized in our white paper (see below) and led directly to our project on [Long-Term "Success" of Green Stormwater Infrastructure](project/2024_LongTermGSI). 
- We are in the **data collection phase** of our project in Wilmington, DE, which is funded by DE Sea Grant and began in Spring 2024.

## Funding
- Support for workshops and discussions with stormwater professionals in the Chesapeake Bay region was provided by a [**NSF Strengthening American Infrastructure** planning grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2228662) (Lead PI: Carolyn; award number 2228662).
- A case study of GSI in Northeast Wilmington, DE is being supported by a **Delaware Sea Grant Institute** grant (Lead PI: Becca Nixon; project number R/RCE-22).
