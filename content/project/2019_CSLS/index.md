## Key Question
Per [2017 Wisconsin Act 10](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2017/related/acts/10), could groundwater withdrawals have a “significant impact” on lakes in the Central Sands of Wisconsin?

## Key Finding
We conclude that groundwater withdrawals for irrigated agriculture **have caused a significant reduction** in the range of high, median, and low lake levels at Long Lake (resulting in impacts to human uses, fish, plants, and chemistry) and Plainfield Lake (resulting in impacts to human uses and plants), while caution is warranted at Pleasant Lake (due to possible or future impacts to lake stratification and dock usage).

## Status
Findings & recommendations were **submitted** to the WI State Legislature in May 2021. See a [pdf](https://zenodo.org/records/5708719) of the full final report and a [video](https://widnr.widen.net/view/video/aka5svaemi/DG_Central_Sands_Lakes_Study_Decision_Overview?u=kfkpym) of my 30-min overview presentation.

## Funding
- **Wisconsin Water Resources Institute** and **Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources**. Wisconsin Water Science-Policy Fellowship. Voter role: postdoctoral fellow.
