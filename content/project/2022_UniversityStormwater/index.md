## Key Questions
- What are the unique stormwater management challenges and opportunities at university campuses?

## Key Findings
- **Regulatory compliance** - not stormwater issues - is the main driver of campus stormwater management activiteis
- Universities wrestle with at times **competing goals** of managing runoff voumes space- and cost-effectively vs. in a visibly "sustainable" manner that yields ecological co-benefits
- There is an opportunity for universities to enhance stormwater management by **leveraging on- and off-campus expertise**

## Status
- Survey and data collection is complete and an associated manuscript is **in preparation**.

## Funding
- **Delaware Water Resources Center** partially supported Rachel's time on this project.
