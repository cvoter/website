## Key Question
How can we meaningfully describe and quantify water level fluctuations in lakes?

## Key Finding
While the [Natural Flow Regime](https://doi.org/10.2307/1313099) and similar frameworks for streams provide a useful starting point for analyzing lake hydrology in an ecologically-relevant way, lakes require a unique analysis that accounts for key differences in their behavior, particularly the higher variability over the scale of decades.

## Status
Initial explorations incorporated into the [Central Sands Lakes Study](project/2019_csls/) analyses. R-package and manuscript in preparation.

## Funding
Carolyn's role on the Central Sands Lakes Study was supported by a **Wisconsin Water Science-Policy Fellowship**. See a peer-reviewed publication and other presentations on this adaptable University-Agency collaboration below.
