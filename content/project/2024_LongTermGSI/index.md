## Key Questions
- In the District of Columbia Department of Environment and Energy RiverSmart Homes program, which residential rain gardens are a "success" ecologically, hydrologically, and socially after 10+ years?
- What site design factors and human behaviors are correlated with "successful" rain gardens?
- How can we predict where "successful" rain gardens will be found?

## Status
