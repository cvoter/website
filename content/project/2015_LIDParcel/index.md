## Key Questions
- How do low-impact stormwater management practices (e.g., "disconnection" of impervious surfaces, soil amendment) interact with one another at the scale of a residential parcel?
- How do low-impact stormwater management practices interact with weather to yield different outcomes under different climatic situations?
- Can we use readily-available lot attributes to prioritize areas for these low-impact practices at the scale of a city? 

## Key Findings
- Practices **targeting impervious-pervious interfaces** experience higher runoff but can increase drainage relative to lots with no imperviousness
- Pairing impervious disconnection with **soil decompaction** synergistically reduces runoff and increases deep drainage and evapotranspiration
- The effectiveness of low-impact stormwater management practices are driven by a) the **aridity index** and b) **between-storm** characteristics.
- Statistical models such as PLSR can be harnessed to **expand fine-scale insights** of complex physical models of urban hydrology.

## Status
Parcel-scale exploration and climate analysis are **published**. City-scale exploration incorporated in Carolyn's dissertation.
