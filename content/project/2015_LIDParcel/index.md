## Key Questions
- How do low-impact stormwater management practices (e.g., "disconnection" of impervious surfaces, soil amendment) interact with one another at the scale of a residential parcel?
- How do low-impact stormwater management practices interact with weather to yield different outcomes under different climatic situations?
- Can we use readily-available lot attributes to prioritize areas for these low-impact practices at the scale of a city? 

## Key Findings
- Practices targeting impervious-pervious interfaces experience higher runoff but can increase drainage relative to lots with no imperviousness
- Pairing impervious disconnection with soil decompaction synergistically reduces runoff and increases deep drainage and evapotranspiration
- The effectiveness of low-impact stormwater management practices are driven by a) the aridity index and b) between-storm characteristics.
- Statistical models such as PLSR can be harnessed to expand fine-scale insights of complex physical models of urban hydrology.

## Status
Parcel-scale exploration and climate analysis completed/published. City-scale exploration incorporated in Carolyn's dissertation. 

## Funding
Carolyn's role as a graduate research assistant was funded by a number of sources procured by Steve Loheide, including a Wisconsin Groundwater Research Advisory Council project and funding from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research site. During this time, Carolyn secured a UW-Madison Weston Fellowship, project assistantships at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Water@UW-Madison program, and collaborated with Steve on a successful Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute proposal on these topics.
