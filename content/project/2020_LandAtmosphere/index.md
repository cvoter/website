## Key Questions
- How are urban water and energy dynamics in regional climate models impacted by robust representation of green infrastructure?
- What insights do these observations yield regarding the impact of greening practices on urban hydrometeorology?

## Key Findings
- Accounting for **sub-grid water transfers** (such as those that occur due to green infrastructure practices) changes the partitioning of land surface fluxes.

## Status
Paper documenting Noah-MP-HUE **published**. Additional manuscripts examining implications for coupled urban land-atmosphere interactions **under review** and **in preparation**.

## Funding
- **Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute**. Mitigating Fooding, Extreme Heat, and Heavy Rainfall in Urban Coastal Communities by “Greening”. Project number: R/RCE-12. Lead PI: Steve Loheide. Voter role: Associate Investigator. 
- Additional funding for Aaron's work secured from the **Milwuakee Metropolitain Sewerage District** by Dan Wright and Steve Loheide.
