## Key Questions
- How are urban water and energy dynamics in regional climate models impacted by robust representation of green infrastructure?
- What insights do these observations yield regarding the impact of greening practices on urban hydrometeorology?

## Key Findings
- Accounting for sub-grid water transfers (such as those that occur due to green infrastructure practices) changes the partitioning of land surface fluxes.

## Status
Paper documenting Noah-MP-HUE published. Additional manuscripts examining implications for coupled urban land-atmosphere interactions under review and in preparation.

## Funding
Initial funding for Aaron secured via a successful [2020-2022 Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute proposal](https://publications.aqua.wisc.edu/download/sg_directory_2020-pdf/?tmstv=1719861097) that Carolyn co-led with Steve Loheide and Dan Wright.
