        We are broadly interested in the interactions among water, ecosystems, and people. In terms of *Hydrologic Processes*, we currently have a strong focus on **Urban Hydrology** as well as broader **Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions**. Our core *Approaches* included developing novel integrated hydrologic **Modeling Tools** and incorporating **Community Engagement**.
