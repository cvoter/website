## Key Question
Where and when is soil amendment most effective as a low-impact stormwater management practice?

## Key Finding
Amending soil on as little as 1.5% of sloped yard near disconnected impervious features can reduce runoff by up to 17% when existing soil infiltration is low; this could be promoted as a **LID alternative to rain gardens** for some homeowners.

## Status
This work is **published**.
