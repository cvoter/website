## Key Question
Where and when is soil amendment most effective as a low-impact stormwater management practice?

## Key Finding
Amending soil on as little as 1.5% of sloped yard near disconnected impervious features can reduce runoff by up to 17% when existing soil infiltration is low; this could be promoted as a LID alternative to rain gardens for some homeowners.

## Status
Complete/published.

## Funding
Carolyn's role as a graduate research assistant was funded by a number of sources procured by Steve Loheide, including a Wisconsin Groundwater Research Advisory Council project and funding from the North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research site. During this time, Carolyn secured a UW-Madison Weston Fellowship, project assistantships at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Water@UW-Madison program, and collaborated with Steve on a successful Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute proposal on these topics.
