abstract: Many of today's water resources challenges are wicked problems, demanding
  innovative solutions across the science-policy-management nexus. Simultaneously,
  early-career researchers in water resources face a shifting professional landscape
  in which academic career paths are sparse but where versatile skill sets relevant
  to water resources issues in governments, non-governmental organizations, and the
  private sector are in high demand. Here, we describe an adaptable fellowship model
  that has proven to be a ``win-win-win'' for early-career researchers, government
  agencies, and universities tackling wicked water resources challenges in Wisconsin,
  USA. The fellowship program recruits post-masters and post-doctoral fellows to lead
  research on a water resources challenge identified as a high priority by a government
  agency partner. Fellows receive mentorship from both academic and agency mentors
  and co-produce actionable knowledge. Costs and administrative responsibilities are
  shared by the university (Sea Grant/Water Resources Institute) and the host agency.
  Since its inception in 2015, this program has trained 24 fellows across 11 host
  programs on issues that range from highly quantitative water quality and hydrogeological
  questions to qualitative assessments of fisheries management and coastal hazards.
  In this arrangement, fellows receive collaborative and cross-disciplinary training
  that prepares them well for diverse career paths, government agencies benefit from
  new knowledge targeted at pressing water resources management questions, and university
  institutions accomplish their missions of training researchers and developing actionable
  knowledge. We describe this model's applicability to other regions and institutions.
  Ultimately, this type of program benefits society by building long-term capacity
  for collaboration which addresses wicked water problems.
