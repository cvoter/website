abstract: To increase the adoption and reliability of low impact development (LID)
  practices for stormwater runoff management and other co-benefits, we must improve
  our understanding of how climate (i.e. patterns in incoming water and energy) affects
  LID hydrologic behavior and effectiveness. While others have explored the effects
  of precipitation patterns on LID performance, the role of energy availability and
  well-known ecological frameworks based on the aridity index (ratio of potential
  evapotranspiration (ET) to precipitation, PET:P) such as Budyko theory are almost
  entirely absent from the LID scientific literature. Furthermore, it has not been
  tested whether these natural system frameworks can predict the fate of water retained
  in the urban environment when human interventions decrease runoff. To systematically
  explore how climate affects LID hydrologic behavior, we forced a process-based hydrologic
  model of a baseline single-family parcel and a parcel with infiltration-based LID
  practices with meteorological records from 51 U.S. cities. Contrary to engineering
  design practice which assumes precipitation intensity is the primary driver of LID
  effectiveness (e.g. through use of design storms), statistical analysis of our model
  results shows that the effects of LID practices on long-term surface runoff, deep
  drainage, and ET are controlled by the relative balance and timing of water and
  energy availability (PET:P, 30 d correlation of PET and P) and measures of precipitation
  intermittency. These results offer a new way of predicting LID performance across
  climates and evaluating the effectiveness of infiltration-based, rather than retention-based,
  strategies to achieve regional hydrologic goals under current and future climate
  conditions.
