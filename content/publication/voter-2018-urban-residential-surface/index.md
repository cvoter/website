abstract: Accurately predicting the hydrologic effects of urbanization requires an
  understanding of how hydrologic processes are affected by low-impact development
  practices. In this study, we explored how growing season surface runoff, deep drainage,
  and evapotranspiration on a residential parcel are affected by several low-impact
  interventions, including three \"impervious-centric\" interventions (disconnecting
  downspouts, disconnecting sidewalks, and adding a transverse slope to the driveway
  and front walk), two \"pervious-centric\" interventions (decompacting soil and adding
  microtopography), and all possible \"holistic\" combinations. Results were compared
  to both a highly and moderately compacted baseline parcel under an average and a
  dry weather scenario for a temperate climate. We find that under reasonable assumptions
  for highly compacted soil, pervious areas are a major source of runoff and disconnecting
  impervious surfaces may be relatively less effective without improving soil conditions.
  Under both highly and moderately compacted soil conditions, combining efforts to
  decompact soil with impervious disconnection has a synergistic effect on reducing
  surface runoff and increasing deep drainage and evapotranspiration. All combinations
  of interventions enhance infiltration, but the partitioning of additional root zone
  water between deep drainage and evapotranspiration depends on the weather scenario.
  Importantly, when all low-impact interventions are applied together, growing season
  deep drainage is higher than that from a vacant lot with no impervious surfaces.
  We infer that ecohydrologic interfaces between impervious and pervious areas are
  strong controls on urban hydrologic fluxes and that high-resolution, process-based
  models can be used to account for these interfaces and thereby improve predictions
  of the hydrologic effects of low-impact interventions.
