abstract: Though urban areas represent a small fraction of global land cover, they
  have an outsized impact on hydrological processes. Within these areas, the pathways
  that water follows are fundamentally transformed by the disturbance of soils, land
  cover, vegetation, topography, and built infrastructure. While progress has been
  made across many cities to quantify interactions between hydrological processes
  and the urban environment, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. In this
  article, we review the state of urban hydrologic science, with an eye towards identifying
  gaps in our understanding of how water flows through built landscapes. Our review
  focuses on key topics within urban hydrology related to water quantity, including
  runoff and streamflow generation, soils and soil water, groundwater, vegetation,
  and climate. We also describe some of the challenges and opportunities within the
  field of urban hydrology that we envision will drive future work and collaboration.
