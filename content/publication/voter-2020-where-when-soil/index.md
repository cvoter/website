abstract: Improving the infiltration capacity of urban soil is critical for effective
  stormwater management, but existing guidance on soil amendment in residential areas
  typically calls for tilling and amending soil throughout the entire yard, an approach
  that is most feasible during development or redevelopment. To develop guidance on
  less-extensive soil amendment interventions which a homeowner could implement postconstruction,
  we designed a modeling study to compare four scenarios targeting soil amendment
  in a single-family yard (1) at disconnected impervious features, (2) at locations
  with large upslope drainage areas, (3) at locations with a high topographic wetness
  index (TWI), and (4) randomly (control). We find that soil amendment may be ineffective
  at reducing runoff from residential areas with high near-surface infiltration rates
  (e.g., Ksat $>$ 1 × 10-2 m/hr), but can reduce runoff by 46%--73% (up to 15% of
  precipitation) on yards with lower near-surface infiltration rates. We find that
  targeting amendment at interfacial hotspots near disconnected impervious surfaces
  can reduce runoff by over 10× more than amending a random equivalent area and by
  at least 2× more than targeting amendment by drainage area or TWI. We suggest including
  this intervention in the suite of low impact development practices promoted to residential
  property owners since it effectively and efficiently reduces runoff and may appeal
  to homeowners who are wary of maintenance needs of other practices.
