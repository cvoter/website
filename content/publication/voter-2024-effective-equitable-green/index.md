abstract: 'Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is “the range of measures that use plant or soil systems, permeable pavement or other permeable surfaces or substrates, stormwater harvest and reuse, or landscaping to store, infiltrate, or evapotranspire stormwater and reduce flows to sewer systems or to surface waters.” Given the importance of GSI to meet water quality standards for urban stormwater runoff and its ancillary benefits from community “greening,” our team of researchers at the University of Delaware sought to understand how municipalities and government agencies can equitably distribute and maximize the benefits of GSI for stormwater management and society, while minimizing the barriers to achieving these goals.'
