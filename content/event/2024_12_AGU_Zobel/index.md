abstract: Effective stormwater management is a vital strategy for addressing concerns like runoff pollution, flood control, and aging infrastructure. Universities often possess infrastructure comparable to that of a small town, making them subject to certain unfunded federal mandates, particularly concerning stormwater management. However, unlike municipalities, universities primarily focus on advancing academic learning rather than managing public infrastructure and services. This distinction creates unique challenges in allocating resources to meet these unfunded requirements. Unfortunately, studies specific to stormwater management on university campuses are notably limited, hindering collaboration within and across universities as well as between universities and local governments. To investigate current stormwater challenges, approaches, and opportunities, we employed semi-structured interviews with personnel across 7 university campuses. For additional information, we reviewed publicly available reports and stormwater management plans for each university. The universities included in this study are member institutions in the mid-Atlantic region of the National Institutes for Water Resources (NIWR) and thus have a mandate to support water resources research, training, and collaboration at the state level. This affiliation may enhance their capabilities in stormwater management through access to advanced research, innovative technologies, and active involvement of students and faculty. Here, we present data from this comprehensive review of stormwater management at universities and highlight the logistical and technical challenges to integrating water science, water policy, and day-to-day facilities management. This research emphasizes the growing need for both internal and external collaboration among universities and sets the stage for further studies on stormwater management on campuses.
