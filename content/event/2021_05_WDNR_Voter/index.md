# Enter presentation abstract, use quotation marks.
abstract: 'In the past several decades, we have witnessed low water levels in water resources throughout the Central Sands, driven by changes in weather and land use. Due to concern about groundwater pumping from high-capacity wells, the DNR collaborated with the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Wisconsin System to complete the Central Sands Lakes Study in 2021. The study used extensive data collection and groundwater flow modeling to evaluate the impacts of groundwater withdrawals on lake levels for Pleasant, Long and Plainfield Lakes in Waushara County.'
